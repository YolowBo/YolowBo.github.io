                <p>This section will be going through the history of badminton from its ancient origins to the modern-day sport played around the world. Taking a look at how early games like battledore and shuttlecock evolved into what we now know as badminton.</p>

                <p>Badminton evolved from ancient shuttlecock games, known collectively as "battledore and shuttlecock," played in ancient Greece, China, India, and Japan over 2000 years ago. In these early versions, players used simple paddles (battledores) to volley a shuttlecock without letting it hit the ground.</p>
                <p>In the mid 19th century, British military officers stationed in <span class="toolTip" data-info="modern-day Pune">Poona</span>, India, adapted this pastime by adding a net and more formal rules. The game became known as "Poona". These officers brought the sport to England in the early 1870s. In 1873 the Duke of Beaufort hosted a lawn party at his estate, Badminton House, where the game was showcased, it soon adopted the name "badminton".</p>
                <p>In 1877 when the Bath Badminton Club in England drafted the first set of playing rules. In 1893, the Badminton Association of England (BAE) was founded and published the first official international rules. The All England Open Badminton Championships began shortly thereafter in 1899 and quickly became the world's premier event.</p>

                <p>Badminton matches are played using a best of three games format. Each game is played to 21 points, and a point is scored on every rally regardless of who served. <br> <br>
                    <span class = "FocusTxt">Winning game rule: </span>A side must win by two clear points once the score reaches 20 20. If the score reaches 29 29, the side that scores the 30th point wins the game. <br> <br>
                    <span class = "FocusTxt">Serving rules: </span>The shuttle must be struck below the server's waist or below 1.15m above the court at contact and the server must deliver the serve diagonally into the opponent's service box, remaining stationary with both feet touching the court until contact. <br> <br>
                    <span class = "FocusTxt"><span class="toolTip" data-info="1 VS 1">Singles</span> vs <span class="toolTip" data-info="2 VS 2">Doubles</span> specifics: </span>For singles, the service court is long and narrow meanwhile in doubles, it is short and wide but uses the full width during rallies. As for doubles, the serving side alternates service courts every time they score a point, and only the player receiving the serve can return it. <br> <br>
                    <span class = "FocusTxt">Fault: </span>Touching the net, hitting the shuttle twice, causing obstruction, or serving illegally count as faults. <br> <br>
                    <span class = "FocusTxt">Change of ends and intervals: </span>Players change ends at the end of the first game, and again at the end of the second if a third game is required. In the third game, side change occurs when the leading score reaches 11 points.
